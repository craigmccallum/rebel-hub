# Breakpoints

There are 5 breakpoints available to make building out pages in line with Figma designs as streamlined as possible:

- `m` - `Mobile` - Screens from 0px to 599px
- `t` - `Tablet` - Screens from 600px to 1024px
- `l` - `Laptop` - Screens from 1025px to 1271px
- `d` - `Desktop` - screens from 1272px up

`m`, `t` and `l` are the 3 primary breakpoints and should be sufficient to cover 99% of use cases.

`lm` is there for when designs really need to differ between small and large mobiles.

`d` is there for when a specific desktop design is required. Both situations are unlikely but it's useful to know the options are there if needed.

Using a mobile-first design system, all styles are from `m` and up by defualt.
